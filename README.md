# OpenStack Exporter Operator

This is a machine charm that deploys [OpenStack Exporter](https://github.com/openstack-exporter/openstack-exporter)
to expose information gathered from OpenStack for use by the Prometheus monitoring system.
This operator works with the Canonical Observability Stack (COS) and Charmed Openstack.

User documentation is available on [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/openstack-exporter).
