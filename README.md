# OpenStack Exporter Operator

**Work in progress**

This is a charm that deploys [OpenStack Exporter](https://github.com/openstack-exporter/openstack-exporter)
to expose information gathered from OpenStack for use by the Prometheus monitoring system.
This operator works with the Canonical Observability Stack (COS) and Charmed Openstack.

User documentation will be available on charmhub once it is published: https://charmhub.io/openstack-exporter-operator

For developer documentation, please see [./CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
