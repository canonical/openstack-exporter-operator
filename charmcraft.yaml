        Custom SSL CA for keystone if required.

        The format should be the raw contents of a PEM encoded file.
        (no base64 encoding).
    cache_ttl:
      default: "300s"
      type: string
      description: |
        Cache expiry time-to-live (TTL), e.g., 10s, 11m, 12h. Cache refreshes at
        intervals of cache_ttl/2.
        Customizable based on the size of the OpenStack cluster.
        Format details: https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration
    cache:
      default: true
      type: boolean
      description: |
        By default, enables the exporter cache globally. Refreshes at intervals of cache_ttl/2.
        If the cache is empty or expired, the response will be empty.
    snap_channel:
      default: "latest/stable"
      type: string
      description: |
        The charmed-openstack-exporter snap is by default installed from the latest/stable channel.
        This option allows the selection of a different channel.

        In case the openStack-exporter resource has been attached, this option has no effect.

      Snap for openstack-exporter.
      This is the software that implements actual metrics collection and an endpoint for prometheus
      scraping. The snap resource on Charmhub is intended to be an empty file. The charm will
      ignore an empty file resource and normally install the snap from the snap store, but a
      custom snap can also be provided here if needed.

      This resource has top priority. If the resource is present, the snap_channel option will have no effect.
